# Robotic Simulation in MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB script to simulate a robotic scenario in a 3D environment. The script sets up the environment, adds obstacles, plans a path for the robot, and visualizes the robot's movement through the environment.

## Overview

### Initialization

Creates a `robotScenario` object and adds a floor to the environment.

### Adding Walls

Adds both outer and inner walls to create obstacles and pathways. The walls are defined with specific dimensions and colors.

### Visualization

Displays the 3D environment with lighting and view settings.

### Binary Occupancy Map

Creates and displays a binary occupancy map to represent the obstacles in the environment.

### Path Planning

Uses a PRM planner to find a path from a starting position to a goal position, generating waypoints for the robot to follow.

### Trajectory Generation

Generates a trajectory for the robot to follow, including timing information.

### Robot Setup

Loads the Husky robot model and sets up its trajectory in the simulation environment.

### Visualization of Waypoints

Displays the environment and plots the waypoints in the 3D view.

### Running the Simulation

Runs the simulation, updating the scenario at a rate of 20 Hz, and stops when the robot reaches the goal position.

   # Robotic Simulation in MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB script developed as part of our 2nd-year minor project. The project aims to simulate a robotic scenario in a 3D environment, integrating key concepts from robotics, path planning, and control systems.

## Project Goals

The primary objective of this project was to simulate an autonomous robot navigating through a complex environment, avoiding obstacles and reaching a specified goal. The simulation demonstrates real-world applications like robotic navigation, autonomous vehicles, and smart robotics in dynamic environments.

## Our Contribution

As part of our coursework, we developed this simulation to apply theoretical knowledge gained in subjects like control systems, kinematics, and MATLAB programming. The project involved setting up the 3D environment, designing obstacles, implementing a path-planning algorithm, and simulating the robotâ€™s trajectory using MATLAB's Robotics System Toolbox.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, we:

- Developed proficiency in MATLAB and Robotics System Toolbox.
- Gained hands-on experience in robotic simulations and path planning.
- Understood how to model real-world robotics problems in a controlled environment.
- Worked as a team to complete the project, improving collaboration and project management skills.
