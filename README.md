# Autobot
# Robotic Simulation with MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB script for setting up and simulating a robotic scenario in a 3D environment. The simulation involves a robot navigating through a grid with obstacles and walls. The script demonstrates environment setup, path planning, and visualization of the robot's movement.

## Script Overview

### Initialization

```matlab
scenario = robotScenario(UpdateRate=5);
