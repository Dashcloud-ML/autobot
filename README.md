# Autobot
# Robotic Simulation with MATLAB

This repository contains a MATLAB script for setting up and simulating a robotic scenario in a 3D environment. The simulation involves a robot navigating through a grid with obstacles and walls. The script demonstrates environment setup, path planning, and visualization of the robot's movement.

## Script Overview

### Initialization

```matlab
scenario = robotScenario(UpdateRate=5);

Result
The script sets up a simulated environment with walls and obstacles, plans a path for the robot from a starting position to a goal position, and visualizes the robot’s movement through the environment. The environment and the robot’s trajectory are displayed in a 3D view, showing how the robot navigates through the obstacles.

Requirements
MATLAB
Robotics System Toolbox
Usage
Copy the script into a MATLAB environment.
Run the script to initialize the scenario and start the simulation.
Observe the robot navigating through the 3D environment in the MATLAB figure window.
